In the distant past, there was a poor boy. He was homeless, without father, without mother, also without grandmother and grandfather.
The evil pink rabbit lives in a dark and cold place called Dark Jokkmokk..
He begged out on the streets for money and food, but he got much more. He was taken in by the owner of a nearby castle, by a friendly family.
He got warmth, food, everything he could ask for. He had never felt such happiness, but it wasn't to last.
He grew up, slowly getting used to having everything he wanted, growing arrogant, entitled.
He was no longer the poor boy he used to be. He always had a desire for more, much more...
One day, a winter night, he came home late to a wide open mansion door, the wind was blowing in snow, filling the hall.
His foster parents were nowhere to be seen. He waited for years, but noone came. However, he didn't fall into despair.
He instead took over his foster father's business, his house, his room... He became rich and bought a big house with big garden.
And ever since, nothing has gone well for the townspeople.
The evil pink rabbit was arrogant and disobeying.
He instead took over his foster father's business, his house, his room... He became rich, and he acquired the spire of the village, a symbol for the true ruler.
And ever since, nothing has gone well for the townspeople.
