He was inside of the surrounding walls, and this was a mansion, not a castle, so he just walked in the front doors.
He walked up, aiming for his father's study. There wasn't a single soul in the mansion, it was ill kept, void of the happy servants that once filled the halls.
And arrived to sobbing and scribbling on paper. His, as he found out, foster brother was sitting at a desk, holding a piece of paper with one hand, writing with the other.
The paper he was writing on was a mess of wet tears and ink. He didn't seem to notice, or care, that the true son had arrived.
Our hero walked around the desk, and looked at the paper.
"Dear son, you may not be my biological child, you may have faults, but if my first son is my blood, you are my soul, I believe in you. I leave the village in your hands.
I will go on an adventure, see the world. I wanted to go much earlier, but I had my village. But now, now that you've grown up, I'll leave it in your hands.
Please, don't miss me, I will surely be back. Take care.
- Your Loving Father"
Our hero merely put his hand on his brother's back, and stood there in silence.
