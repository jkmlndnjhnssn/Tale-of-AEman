Naturally, there was a catch. The mayor of the town had a real son, a kind, loving soul with an adventurer's spirit.
He rose up early in life, looking like a great successor to his father, he had fantastic potential.
He didn't want to be holed up in the village forever, however, so he decided to travel. Travel until he was tired.
He knew it would make his father lonely for a time, but the chick needs to leave its roost at some point.
As he travelled, he only furthered his skills. His physique, his charisma, everything about him was slowly refined into what he became today.
He also found a compass, made from green stones, which he carried with him for years to come, guiding him to his next goal.
Now, he was tired, he was growing out of his prime, so he returned, finally ready to take his father's mantle.
