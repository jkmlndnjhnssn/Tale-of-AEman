Naturally, there was a catch. The mayor of the town had a real daughter, a kind, loving soul with an adventurer's spirit.
She rose up early in life, looking like a great successor to his father, she had fantastic potential.
He didn't want to be holed up in the village forever, however, so he decided to travel. Travel until he was tired.
He knew it would make his father lonely for a time, but the chick needs to leave its roost at some point.
As he travelled, he only furthered his skills. His physique, his charisma, everything about him was slowly refined into what he became today.
Now, he was tired and frustrated, he was growing out of his prime, so he returned, finally ready to take his father's robe.
He was smart, nonselfish and kind hearted person.
