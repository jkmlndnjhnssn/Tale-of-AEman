Things might not end the way you think, and people might not be as heartless as you think.
The world is constantly changing, so you too, need to change with the world.
It might be scary at first, risking losing yourself, but surround yourself with trusting and loving people, and keep an open, loving mind, and things will go well.
You may not end up where you think you would, you may not do all that you wanted, but that is okay.
Appreciate what you have, and enjoy the world as it is.
