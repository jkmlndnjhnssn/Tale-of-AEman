At the foot of the valley, he only needed to reach the castle at the top, it wasn't far.
The town was large, but it could not compare to the great lengths he had walked in his previous travels.
He, of course, needed to avoid being seen by the guards, outsiders were not permitted to get in, and for all intents and purposes...
He was one. Especially to the current mayor, the fake mayor. He scaled the outside wall, getting in from above.
He travelled carefully, going from roof to roof, all the buildings were connected by wooden bars, making it convenient.
At times, he needed to stop, hide from the spying eyes of the night guard, but it went smooth.
He wasn't weighed down by any equipment, so his step was quiet. After some time, he got to the backyard.
